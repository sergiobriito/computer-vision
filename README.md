# Computer Vision Visualizer
Application using the Streamlit library for computer vision tasks. It provides several functionalities for face recognition, hand recognition, and other applications.

## The code includes the following functionalities:

Face Mesh Detection: Uses the FaceMesh model from the mediapipe library to detect and draw landmarks on faces in real-time video streams.

Hand Detection: Utilizes the Hands model from mediapipe to detect and draw landmarks on hands in real-time video streams.

Finger Counting: Implements a finger counting system by tracking hand landmarks and determining the number of fingers extended.

Take Picture: Allows the user to capture an image from the video stream by performing a specific hand gesture.
